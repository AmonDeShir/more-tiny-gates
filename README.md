[**More Tiny Gates**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-tiny-gates) is an add-on for Tiny Gates Add-on that adds a few more logical gates.

## New Gates
**NAND Gate** - negated AND gate.\
**NOR Gate** - negated OR gate.\
**XNOR Gate** - Exclusive NOR gate.

## New Elements
**Diode** - transmits signal one sided (works similar to a repeater but doesn't amplify signal).\
**Limiter** - limits the received redstone signal to the reference value.\
**Generator** - generates a redstone signal (power can be configured by left-clicking on the generator). It is turned off if powered.
